# Â¡Hola! ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects repository**.

The goal with this repository is to **show some of the projects I have worked on in the field of *Machine Learning*, *Deep Learning* and *NLP***. Generally I will upload .ipynb files from **Jupyter Notebook** for the ease of explaining the steps I go through to create the models. For any questions or comments please send me a message on [my Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/borja-bajo/) ðŸ’¬
